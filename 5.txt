Web crawling to extract text and image from a website

Components need to be -

Crawler: A web crawler browses the internet like a spider, indexing and searching for material by clicking on links.
We first need to "crawl" the web to gather the necessary URLs, which you then send to your scraper.

Data locators in the scrapper are used to locate the data you want to extract from the HTML file.

Method: To scrape data from your page, we use an HTTP requests library (such the Python-Requests library) and the Python BeautifulSoup library.

Approach:
1) Determine the destination webpage.
2) Compile the URLs of the pages you wish to use for data extraction.Â 
3) Send a request to these URLs to obtain the page's HTML.
4) Utilize locators to locate the text and images in the HTML.
5) Put the information in a file.
